Hi, my name is Jaime Castaneda. I am currently a junior at DePaul University. I'm  majoring in computer science 
with a concentration in software development and minoring in software engineering and data science. I am 
currently a software engineer intern at RadicalX! I plan on continuing my career and becoming a software 
engineer after I graduate. Some skills that I possess are knowing how to code in Java, Python, C++, C, 
JavaScript, Swift, and R. I also know OOP, SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms, etc. I'm looking for new 
opportunities to show off these skills!
