Hi, my name is Jaime Castaneda. I am currently a senior at DePaul University. I'm  majoring in computer science 
with a concentration in software development and minoring in data science. I am currently looking for internships
and opportunities to grow. I plan on continuing my career and becoming a software engineer after graduation.
